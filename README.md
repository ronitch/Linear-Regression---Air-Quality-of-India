# Linear-Regression---Air-Quality-of-India

The dataset contains air quality data and AQI (Air Quality Index) at hourly and daily level of various stations across multiple cities in India.
With the worsening air quality, the population is placed at an increased risk of health problems. 

The aim of this analysis is to be able to predict in future the daily Air Quality Index of India so that the population can be warned in advance of the dangerous air quality and encourage wearing air masks or avoiding going out altogether.
